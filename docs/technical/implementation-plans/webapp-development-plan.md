# Yeezles Todo - Web Application Development Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

We're building a single-user web application that connects to the existing Yeezles Todo API. The frontend will be deployed to Railway and include authentication for security.

## ðŸ“Š Existing API Analysis

Based on the API documentation, we have access to a comprehensive REST API with:

### Core Features Available:
- **CRUD Operations**: Full todo management (create, read, update, delete)
- **Advanced Filtering**: By completion status, tags, due dates, search queries
- **Tag System**: Auto-extraction from text using @tagname format
- **Smart Scheduling**: "Today" view with overdue, due today, coming soon categorization
- **Cross-References**: Auto-linking between todos using #123 format
- **Full-Text Search**: SQLite FTS5 powered search across titles and descriptions
- **Export/Import**: JSON-based data portability
- **Backup System**: Automated database backups with retention policies

### API Endpoints Available:
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /todos` - Basic CRUD
- `GET /todos/:id` - Single todo retrieval
- `GET /todos/today` - Smart today view
- `GET /export` - Data export
- `POST /import` - Data import
- `GET/POST /backup/*` - Backup management

## ðŸ¤” Strategic Questions for Planning

### 1. **Technology Stack Preferences**
- **Frontend Framework**: What's your preference?
  - React (most popular, great ecosystem)
  - Vue.js (gentle learning curve, great developer experience)
  - Svelte (modern, compile-time optimized)
  - Vanilla JavaScript (simple, no framework overhead)

- **Styling Approach**: How do you want to handle CSS?
  - Tailwind CSS (utility-first, rapid development)
  - CSS Modules (scoped styles)
  - Styled Components (CSS-in-JS)
  - Traditional CSS/SCSS

### 2. **User Experience & Interface**
- **Layout Style**: What kind of interface appeals to you?
  - Single-page dashboard (everything visible)
  - Multi-view application (separate pages for different features)
  - Card-based layout (Trello-style)
  - List-based layout (traditional todo style)

- **Mobile Experience**: How important is mobile responsiveness?
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Desktop-focused with basic mobile support
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities

### 3. **Authentication & Security**
- **Authentication Method**: Since it's single-user, what approach?
  - Simple password protection (single shared password)
  - Basic HTTP Authentication
  - JWT-based sessions
  - Social login (GitHub, Google) even for single user

- **Session Management**: How long should sessions last?
  - Remember me functionality
  - Auto-logout after inactivity
  - Manual logout only

### 4. **Feature Priorities**
Which features are most important to implement first?

**Core Features (MVP):**
- [ ] Basic todo CRUD operations
- [ ] Tag filtering and display
- [ ] Today view with smart categorization
- [ ] Basic search functionality

**Enhanced Features:**
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Backup management interface
- [ ] Cross-reference link navigation
- [ ] Advanced filtering UI
- [ ] Drag-and-drop task organization
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle

**Advanced Features:**
- [ ] Real-time updates (if multiple browser tabs)
- [ ] Offline support (PWA)
- [ ] Rich text editing for descriptions
- [ ] Due date calendar interface
- [ ] Analytics/productivity insights

### 5. **Deployment & Infrastructure**
- **Railway Deployment**: Any specific requirements?
  - Environment variable management
  - Custom domain setup
  - SSL/HTTPS configuration
  - Database connection strategy (will API and frontend share the same database?)

- **Build & Development**: Preferences for tooling?
  - Vite (fast, modern bundler)
  - Webpack (traditional, highly configurable)
  - Parcel (zero-config bundler)

### 6. **Development Approach**
- **Step-by-step vs. Full Feature**: Given your learning-focused approach:
  - Build and test each feature incrementally
  - Create a basic working version first, then enhance
  - Focus on specific user workflows

- **Testing Strategy**: How much testing do you want?
  - Unit tests for critical logic
  - Integration tests for API communication
  - End-to-end tests for user workflows
  - Manual testing only

## ðŸš€ Recommended Initial Architecture

Based on the existing API and best practices, I recommend:

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (matches API's type safety approach)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid development, consistent design)
- **State Management**: React Query + Context (great for API integration)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast development, optimized production builds)
- **Authentication**: JWT with HTTP-only cookies

### Project Structure:
```
